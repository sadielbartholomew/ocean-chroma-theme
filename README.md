# ocean-chroma-theme

### A fresh dark colour theme for Emacs 24+ based on blue-green and primary colours

:pushpin: **This theme is functional and can be used, but note it is under
development so currently just contains some customisation.** :pushpin:

Namely, the theme as-is only sets:

* full customisation covering *all* built-in faces and generic elements
  (e.g. those relating to the fringe, highlighting, incremental search,
  the mode line, tool tips, links, diffs etc.);

* full customisation of *many* built-in modes, though not all of them (other
  than indirect customisation by inheritance of faces that are already
  directly customised), those modes currently being:
  * org mode;
  * outline mode;
  * compilation mode;
  * diff mode;
  * smerge mode;
  * whitespace mode;
  * dired;

* full customisation of *some* third-party modules, namely (so far):
  * col-highlight;
  * hl-line;
  * diff-hl.


## Underlying colour scheme

Only sixteen harmonious colours are used for this theme, namely the
following palette:

## Screenshots

Screenshots of the theme in use will be added when the theme becomes more mature.
