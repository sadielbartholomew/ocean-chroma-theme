# ocean-chroma-theme
### A fresh dark colour theme for Emacs 24+ based on blue-green and primary colours

:warning: **This theme is functional and can be used, but note it is under
development so only currently contains some customisation as-is.** :warning:

Namely, the theme as-is currently sets:

* full customisation for built-in faces and generic elements;
* full customisation of *certain* built-in modes *only* (the rest not being
  touched at all except through default face inheritance), those modes
  currently being:
  * Outline mode;
  * Compilation mode;
  * Org mode.

Screenshots of the theme in use will be added when the theme becomes more mature.
