# ocean-chroma-theme

### A fresh dark colour theme for Emacs 24+ based on blue-green and primary colours

:pushpin: **This theme is functional and can be used, but note it is under
development so currently just contains some customisation.** :pushpin:

Namely, the theme as-is only sets:

* full customisation for built-in faces and generic elements;
* full customisation of *certain* built-in modes *only* (the rest not being
  touched at all except through default face inheritance), those modes
  currently being:
  * Outline mode;
  * Compilation mode;
  * Org mode.


## Underlying colour scheme

Only sixteen harmonious colours are used for this theme, namely the
following palette:

![ocean_chroma_theme_colour_palette](img/ocean_chroma_palette.png)


## Screenshots

Screenshots of the theme in use will be added when the theme becomes more mature.
